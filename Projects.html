			<p>For a class assignment, I created an app for Android devices that would document "crimes". You would be able to create a report that you would be able to 
			add a name for the report as well as take a photo that would be saved in the report. You would access these reports through a scrollable list after they were 
			created. You could also choose the time and date that the report was created through a calender that would pop up through the use of datepicker. You could 
			also choose a "suspect" from your contact list and you would also be able to send the
			report to other apps, such as gmail or google drive. I also made it so that you could also edit the report whenever you wanted and made it so that you could 
			check off a report as being solved, which would reflect on the list where you can see all the reports. 
			To save the data, I used a SQL database, so that the reports created could still be accessed later if the app was closed. I also made it so that you would be 
			able to modify reports whenever needed. I used an 
			older API, so that the app would be compatible on more devices and the API I used was API 21.

		<button class="dropdown">Hash Table</button>
		<div class="container">
			<p>For a class assignment, I created a Hash Table program in C++ that would recieve a word list with about 200000 words that would need to be put into the table.
			The hashing function that I used was that I would first take the string of the text and turn it into ascii and subtract that number by 97. I would then
			convert that resulting number, which would be in the range 0-25, into a prime number that I had in an array. For example the letter b would convert
			to the prime number 3, and the letter f would turn into 13. Once all the letters of the string were converted I would multiply them all together to get a
			unique number that would then be modded with the size of the table to know what index to put it at. Also as part of the project I created a menu that would
			be able to search, insert, and delete words that were in the table. The table it self was a linked list that held linked lists within it and the size of it
			would be determined manually when running the program. When searching for words the time it took to find it would also be displayed.

		<button class="dropdown">DVD Manager Program</button>
		<div class="container">
			<p>I created this program to learn about how to use Java Swing. The program starts by laoding a file that you choose and would use swing to create the GUI.
			The program is capable of displaying all the DVDs stored in the file in a list format, which would be the name, rating and run time of the DVD. When the DVDs 
			are displayed, you are able to add or remove DVDs from the list. The file would be overwritten if the program made changes to the list that was initially
			loaded. The program was relatively simple in function, but it helped me learn how to create a GUI with lists, buttons, and how to integrate it with normal
			code.
